Planned cache implementation: 
We plan to store user information and saved captions. We will store user's twitterID, name, username, and a list of the photo-caption pairs they saved so that we can show them to the user later.
We plan to cache the lyrics associated with the words we received describing the photo from the first API call to the clarifai API. Then, we will use those cached words and lyrics in order to call the last API to pick a caption for the photo.
